# Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis_Using_Tableau
This project showcases a comprehensive Tableau dashboard created to analyze the sales performance of an ecommerce business. It visualizes key metrics such as sales, profit, and order quantity with YoY comparisons, helping identify growth trends and performance gaps.

The dashboard includes a breakdown of market share by region, monthly customer acquisition patterns, and category-wise sales analysis. It uses interactive elements and intuitive visualsâ€”like arrows, sparklines, and color-coded barsâ€”to make the data easy to interpret for strategic decision-making.
